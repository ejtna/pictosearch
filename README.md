## :rocket: Install it
The easiest way to install this plugin is to download the [latest release] and
extract it to `YOUR_WP_INSTALL/wp-content/plugins/`. If you like to use the
latest development version you have to download or clone this repo and compile
all dependencies. On Linux you can use the following commands:

```
cd YOUR_WP_INSTALL/wp-content/plugins/

wget https://github.com/kitsteam/wp-pictogram-viewer/archive/refs/heads/main.zip && unzip main.zip -d arasaac-pictogram-viewer
OR
git clone https://github.com/kitsteam/wp-pictogram-viewer.git arasaac-pictogram-viewer

cd arasaac-pictogram-viewer
yarn install && yarn build
```

After you installed the plugin you have to go to your Wordpress admin dashboard
and enable it. If done so, you can integrate the search and configuration dialog
to every page with the shortcode `[arasaac-pictogram-viewer]`.

## :performing_arts: Adding new translations
Currently this application is available in german and english. To add another
language, the following steps have to been taken:

* add the language short code to the `locales` short code in `i18next-parser.config.js`
* run `yarn i18next`
* translate everything in `src/locales/SHORT_CODE/translation.json`
* include the new data file in `src/locales/index.ts` like the existing

If a new translatable key is added to the code, `yarn i18next` will add it to all
language files.

## :nerd_face: Release guide
To release a new version a few things should be done:

* Bump the version in `package.json`
* Add a version header field in `arasaac-pictogram-viewer.php`, like `* Version:           0.1.0`
* Run `yarn build && yarn run pack`
* Create a signed commit `git commit -S -am "release 0.1.0 :tada:"`
* Push all commits `git push`
* Create a [new Github release](https://github.com/kitsteam/wp-pictogram-viewer/releases/new) and attach the previous packed archive
